# Example keymap file
# To define your own keys for MOC commands, create a keymap file in the ~/.moc/
# directory and add options Keymap = FILE in ~/.moc/config
#
# The format of this file is:
# Lines beginning with # are comments.
# Blank lines are ignored.
# Every other line is expected to be in format:
#
# COMMAND = [KEY ...]
#
# The key can be:
#  - just a char, like i, L, ", *
#  - CTRL-KEY sequence: ^k (CTRL-k), ^4
#  - ALT-KEY (meta sequence): M-j (ALT-j), M-%
#  - Special keys:
#    DOWN
#    UP
#    LEFT
#    RIGHT
#    HOME
#    BACKSPACE
#    DEL
#    INS
#    ENTER
#    PAGE_UP
#    PAGE_DOWN
#    TAB
#    END
#    KEYPAD_CENTER
#    SPACE
#    ESCAPE
#    F1 - F12
#
# Maximum number of keys for one command is 5.
#
# Omitting the key for a command will disassociate the key from the command.
#
# Default key configuration for MOC (and a list of all available commands):
