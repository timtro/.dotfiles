IMPORTANT
=========

Powerline requires custom glyphs to work properly. A font with these glyphs has
been installed along with a fontconfig file which enables the glyphs for many
common coding fonts.

If Powerline doesn't work out of the box on your system, please submit an issue
on GitHub: https://github.com/powerline/powerline/issues

Consult the documentation for detailed installation instructions and
troubleshooting information: https://powerline.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
